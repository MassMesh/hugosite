The Hugo code for the static website at massmesh.org.

We use the hugo-icon theme for the moment. You will need to download it from https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-icon/ and place it in your themes directory.

Run *hugo* to generate the site. If you get the error:

> Error: Error copying static files: 
> chmod /home/members/jamesokeefe/sites/massmesh.org/users/massmeshnet/massmesh.org/web/: operation not permitted

don't worry. It does not prevent the site from being installed in the massmesh.org/web folder.
